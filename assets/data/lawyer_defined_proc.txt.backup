To qualify for a marriage-based visa or green card, you must be legally married. 
A legal marriage is one that is officially recognized by the government in the country or state where you were married. 
This usually means that an official record of your marriage has been made or can be obtained from some public office. 
If that document is not available, then the Petitioner and Beneficiary are NOT LEGALLY MARRIED, thus cannot file an application for a green card based on marriage.

Other Notes (if any)
Note that filing Form I-130 only starts the immigration process for a U.S. citizen’s son or daughter. 
Such a person will be considered a “preference relative” (unlike, for instance, the spouse or unmarried child under 21 of a U.S. citizen, who is an “immediate relative”). Preference relatives, unlike immediate relatives, face annual quotas on the number of visas (green cards) 
given out, and thus may have to wait years after approval of their I-130 for a visa to become available and to continue with their green card application.
